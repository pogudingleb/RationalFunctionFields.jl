# Paper

This directory contains the sources of examples, experiments, and data, for the paper from TODO.

## Data

- `data-1`. The original generating sets for benchmark models from structural identifiability. Also contains the output of our algorithm.

## Benchmarks

- `experiment-1`. Benchmark different methods for computing Groebner bases over rational function fields.
- `experiment-2`. Benchmark computing coefficients of Groebner bases using interpolation. Collect statistics about the degrees and the number of evaluations. Benchmark F4 learn and F4 apply.
- `experiment-3`. Run different benchmarks for all available models. Run maple benchmarks. Create the list of all models for Appendix.
- `experiment-4`. Random stuff.

## Scripts

- `scripts-1`. Populating scripts in `data-1`.
